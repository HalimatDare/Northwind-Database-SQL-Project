# Project Overview: SQL Queries for Northwind Database

This project showcases my proficiency in SQL by leveraging the popular Northwind database, a sample dataset used to simulate a company's operations, including customers, orders, employees, suppliers, and products. I crafted 20 SQL queries to extract valuable insights from this data, covering a range of business use cases such as sales analysis, inventory management, and customer activity.

# Key Highlights:
**1. Data Extraction and Aggregation:** Using JOIN operations across multiple tables (Orders, Customers, OrderDetails, Products),
I was able to fetch crucial business metrics like total sales value, average order prices, and maximum product quantities.

**2. Employee and Customer Insights:** I developed queries that calculate key performance indicators for employees and track customer order trends, such as order volumes and sales values.

**3. Product and Category Analysis:** The queries explore product availability, category-based inventory, and pricing trends, helping understand product-level performance and supplier details.

**4. Advanced Filtering and Grouping:** Implemented complex queries using GROUP BY, HAVING, and date filters to provide detailed reporting and analysis, such as filtering customer orders by year or analyzing sales for orders above specific thresholds.

*This project demonstrates my ability to manipulate, analyze, and generate meaningful insights from structured data, with a focus on efficiency and clarity in SQL query construction.*
